# js-spintax

A Simple Spintax JS application

## Usage

To use it, you have to inform a `input`, a `output` and a `button`.
All the 3 as a CSS selector, like this:

```javascript
SPINTAX.init("#spintax_source", "#spintax_output", "button");
```

After that, you can put up blocks like this: `{I'm a text inside a block|I'm also a text inside a block}` and the script will randomize its contents to show up.

Simple. Really.
